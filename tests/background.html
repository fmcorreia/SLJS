            <p>Like all good projects, SLJS was started after a discussion in a bar during a conference.</p>
            <p>The timeline looks something like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2011-06-08: Discussion in bar at NDC2011</li>
                <li>2011-06-11: First POC completed, failure :-(</li>
                <li>2011-06-13: Back home, second POC success :-)</li>
                <li>2011-06-20: Re-written, several technologies played with</li>
                <li>2011-06-23: Technology chosen/structure-decided</li>
                <li>2011-06-28: First demos finished and supported</li>
                <li>2011-06-29: Time to ask for the experts to come in!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Several templating mechanisms have been toyed with, two IL->JS conversion libraries have been evaluated, 
            and various levels of trying to convert some of the core Silverlight code across have been attempted, but in the end it was decided
            that it would be easier to re-write most of the framework in pure Javascript from the ground up, and simply to focus on the important
            bits first.
            </p>  
            <p>Hopefully this should shed some perspective on the project, it took a month to get anything translated from meatspace into a github repository!</p>
            
            <p>With any luck, these technology decisions will last us a month or so before having to re-evaluate.
