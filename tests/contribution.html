            <h3>Where do I begin?</h3>
            <p>First off, don't go taking your Silverlight project which you've been working on for three years and expect it to work - 
             SLJS doesn't even pretend to have enough of the framework implemented for that!</p>
             <p>Instead, think of a small demo you'd like to add to this site that demonstrates a particular feature you want to get working.</p>
            That could be a control from System.Windows.Controls, it could be a particular aspect of styling, an intricate part of the dependency property/object system or anything else.</p>
            <p>Writing a Silverlight application that demonstrates that concept in the tests solution, letting the Google Group know that you're working on it, 
            and then going to town on the code is the best thing you can do.</p>
            <p>An acceptance testing mechanism has been implemented in the tests folder, and new features should have acceptance tests built around them - it is not necessary
            to go writing unit tests for all your Javascript (although it is acknowledged that parts of the framework will warrant it), but it is important that the big things are captured
            so future efforts don't go making breaking changes everywhere.</p>
            <h3>Contribution Guidelines</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>All features should have acceptance tests written against them</li>
                <li>There is one JS file per .NET namespace and types are ordered however makes sense./li>
                <li>Core .NET types/language issues belong to the JSIL project, although we can try to fix them ourselves and contribute back</li>
                <li>Framework types/methods should all be PascalCase like in the .NET framework</li>
                <li>Our JS types should be PascalCase and JS methods should be camelCase</li>
                <li>In the case where we have .NET types with private methods, they should be camelCase so we know they're not Core Framework</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There isn't much else beyond that, as long as you don't go vomitting code everywhere then we can be fairly relaxed about contributions, better to have code submitted that's a bit different and adapted, 
            than not submitted at all - feature tests will help us integrate it after all.</p>
            <h3>After a feature is finished</h3>
            <p>It will be pulled into the project by a core member, and if you have a good demo showing off the feature it will be added to this site.</p>
