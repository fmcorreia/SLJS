So okay, this is a Silverlight to Javascript converter.

It generates readable JS courtesy of JSIL.

Rather than try to bring across all the .NET core code, 
I am re-implementing the entire framework in Javascript as and when it is needed.

This has some advantages in that we can write (largely) idiomatic Javascript code and not 
have to suffer the disadvantages of trying to fit square pegs into round holes.

It has some disadvantages because it means writing a lot of code. 

C'est la vie, writing code is easy.

For more information, hit me up on Twitter @robashton, you can probably help.
